Project goal: To design a system to prevent theft at retail self checkouts and to explore the potential use and advantages of a multispectral sensor in conjunction with a computer vision (CV) algorithm.

Self checkouts provide a low cost and convenient solution for retailers to improve the shopping experience for their customers. However, self checkouts also experience higher rates of intentional and unintentional theft and often require a visual component to avert this. The key focus of this project was to develop an AI powered CV algorithm to increase the accuracy with which items can be identified, and simultaneously decrease the execution time required to make an inference. The team has accomplished this by testing the speed and accuracy of different algorithm options and analyzing the advantages of multispectral sensor integration.

The system is designed to recognize grocery items accurately by making an inference on images captured in real time. The neural net was trained on a set of augmented prelabeled images to handle a large number of classifiers. The team has tested multiple algorithms such as Faster RCNN and SSD on a small prototype scale and a foundation has been built for further development of CV algorithms for more broad applications. A prototype was successfully developed to account for a number of theft modalities and is offered as a preliminary solution to prevent theft at self checkouts.
